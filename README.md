  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  An application to bring the ancient writing of stoicism to your mobile device. Although, nothing beats the power of pen and paper. Bringing the old philosophy of Roman Emperor and other great thinkers to modern times. A Daily writing prompt for you to think over and reflect through, along with qoutes from fellow stoics such as: Zeno of Citium: The Founder of Stoicism, Chrysippis, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.
