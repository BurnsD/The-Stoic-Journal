  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  After researching Stoicism and personally partaking in the act of journaling, I have decided to slowly build this project. I plan to create a basic application that will allow users to log in to a website to save personal journal entries! Filled with writing prompts and qoutes from famous stoics such as Zeno of Citium, Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus.
   
  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  I plan to personally deploy this application to Heroku. Allowing all use to be functional through a webpage I will link at a later time.
